2009-06-04  Olivier Stasse  <olivier.stasse@aist.go.jp>

jrl-dynamics version 1.13 released March 12, 2009

	32. Fixed abstractRobotDynamics.pc file
	31. Removed autotools related files
	30. Install abstractRobotDynamics.doxytag
	
jrl-dynamics version 1.12 released February 27, 2009

	29. Add new methods in jrlDynamicsRobot: jointsBetween(),
	    getJacobian(), getPositionJacobian(), getOrientationJacobian().
	28. Switch from autoconf to cmake.
	27. Add forces and torques matrices.

jrl-dynamics version 1.11 released October 8, 2008

	26. Added CjrlJoint::{upper|lower}VelocityBound()

jrl-dynamics version 1.10 released April 14, 2008

	25. Removed staticState() from DynamicRobot
	24. Added missing virtual destructors.

jrl-dynamics version 1.9 released March 24, 2008

        23. Added recommended commands in dedicated page.
        22. Added methods to control implementation behavior in
            CjrlDynamicRobot:
          - virtual bool isSupported(const std::string &inProperty) = 0;
          - virtual bool getProperty(const std::string &inProperty,
                                     std::string& outValue) = 0;
          - virtual bool setProperty(std::string &inProperty,
                                     const std::string& inValue) = 0;
            Augmented documentation accordingly: a new page lists the
            recommended commands to be implemented.
        21. Added method setJointOrderInConfig in CjrlDynamicRobot.

jrl-dynamics version 1.8 released February 16, 2008

	20. Added rightHand() and lefHand() methods to CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot
	19. Added documentation about specification of CjrlJoint.
	18. Moved dependence to MatrixAbstractionLayer to implementation.

jrl-dynamics version 1.7 released November 8, 2007

	17. Replace get function
	      virtual void gaze(const vector3d& outDirection,
				const vector3d& outOrigin) const = 0;
	    by a set function
	      virtual void gaze(const vector3d& inDirection,
				const vector3d& inOrigin) = 0;
	    that was missing.
	16. Added some methods in CjrlJoint to set and get the bounds on
	the degrees of freedom of a joint.
	15. CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot now virtually inherits from
	CjrlDynamicRobot in order to enable implementations of these
	classes to inherit from one another.
	14. Added method  bool initialize() in CjrlDynamicRobot in order
	to initialize data-structure relative to dynamic computation once
	the kinematic tree is built.

jrl-dynamics version 1.6 released August 30, 2007

	13. Remove const in addChildJoint (const CjrlJoint& inJoint) in
	order to be able to modify joints in kinematic chain.
	12. CjrlJoint::parentJoint() and CjrlJoint::childJoint(unsigned
	int inJointRank) return pointer to CjrlJoint instead of
	reference.
	11. Added information for developers of implementation of abstract interface.

jrl-dynamics version 1.5 released July 16, 2007

	10. (fumio) add double CjrlDynamicRobot::upperBoundDof(int, const
	vectorN&) and double CjrlDynamicRobot::upperBoundDof(int, const
	vectorN&). They compute a joint angle limit using other joint
	angles if possible.
	9. (fumio) CjrlDynamicRotot::FiniteDifferenceStateUpdate() is
	splitted into two functions. FiniteDifferenceStateEstimate() and
	SaveCurrentStateAsPastState()

jrl-dynamics version 1.4 released July 6, 2007

	9. (fumio) CjrlDynamicRotot::FiniteDifferenceStateUpdate() is
	splitted into two functions. FiniteDifferenceStateEstimate() and
	SaveCurrentStateAsPastState()

jrl-dynamics version 1.3 released June 14, 2007
	8. Added a the new class CjrlHand. It records the center a hand
	and its important axis in the relevant wrist frame.
	7. correct configure.ac to transfert flags and libs in pkgconfig
	6. erase the dependance of *.in et *.m4 with git

jrl-dynamics version 1.2 released May 14, 2007

2007/03/09
	5. Moved inclusion of "MatrixAbstractLayer.h" before other inclusions
	to make sure matrices and vectors are defined.
2007/03/07
	4. The macros in the declaration of the vectors in the files in the
	interface have been replaced by the typedef: vector3d, matrix3d,
	vector4d, matrix4d, vectorN and matrixNxP.
	3. The files in the interface have an include of
	"MatrixAbstractLayer/MatrixAbstractLayer.h"
	2. In CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot, access functions to gaze
	direction and origin take const vector3d& as argument instead of
	vector3d& in order to enforce the const propery of those access
	functions.

	1. Removed template in classes declarations.
