	Moved dependence to MatrixAbstractionLayer to implementation.
	
jrl-dynamics version 1.7 released November 8, 2007

	17. Replace get function
	      virtual void gaze(const vector3d& outDirection,
				const vector3d& outOrigin) const = 0;
	    by a set function
	      virtual void gaze(const vector3d& inDirection,
				const vector3d& inOrigin) = 0;
	    that was missing.
	16. Added some methods in CjrlJoint to set and get the bounds on
	the degrees of freedom of a joint.
	15. CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot now virtually inherits from
	CjrlDynamicRobot in order to enable implementations of these
	classes to inherit from one another.
	14. Added method  bool initialize() in CjrlDynamicRobot in order
	to initialize data-structure relative to dynamic computation once
	the kinematic tree is built.
	
jrl-dynamics version 1.6 released August 30, 2007

	13. Remove const in addChildJoint (const CjrlJoint& inJoint) in
	order to be able to modify joints in kinematic chain.
	12. CjrlJoint::parentJoint() and CjrlJoint::childJoint(unsigned
	int inJointRank) return pointer to CjrlJoint instead of
	reference.
	11. Added information for developers of implementation of abstract interface.
	
jrl-dynamics version 1.5 released July 16, 2007
	
	10. (fumio) add double CjrlDynamicRobot::upperBoundDof(int, const
	vectorN&) and double CjrlDynamicRobot::upperBoundDof(int, const
	vectorN&). They compute a joint angle limit using other joint
	angles if possible.
	9. (fumio) CjrlDynamicRotot::FiniteDifferenceStateUpdate() is
	splitted into two functions. FiniteDifferenceStateEstimate() and
	SaveCurrentStateAsPastState()

jrl-dynamics version 1.4 released July 6, 2007
	
	9. (fumio) CjrlDynamicRotot::FiniteDifferenceStateUpdate() is
	splitted into two functions. FiniteDifferenceStateEstimate() and
	SaveCurrentStateAsPastState()
	
jrl-dynamics version 1.3 released June 14, 2007
	8. Added a the new class CjrlHand. It records the center a hand
	and its important axis in the relevant wrist frame.
	7. correct configure.ac to transfert flags and libs in pkgconfig
	6. erase the dependance of *.in et *.m4 with git

jrl-dynamics version 1.2 released May 14, 2007

2007/03/09
	5. Moved inclusion of "MatrixAbstractLayer.h" before other inclusions 
	to make sure matrices and vectors are defined.
2007/03/07
	4. The macros in the declaration of the vectors in the files in the
	interface have been replaced by the typedef: vector3d, matrix3d,
	vector4d, matrix4d, vectorN and matrixNxP.
	3. The files in the interface have an include of 
	"MatrixAbstractLayer/MatrixAbstractLayer.h"
	2. In CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot, access functions to gaze
	direction and origin take const vector3d& as argument instead of
	vector3d& in order to enforce the const propery of those access
	functions. 
	
	1. Removed template in classes declarations.
