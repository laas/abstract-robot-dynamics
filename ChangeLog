	5. Moved inclusion of "MatrixAbstractLayer.h" before other inclusions 
	to make sure matrices and vectors are defined.

	4. The macros in the declaration of the vectors in the files in the
	interface have been replaced by the typedef: vector3d, matrix3d,
	vector4d, matrix4d, vectorN and matrixNxP.
	3. The files in the interface have an include of 
	"MatrixAbstractLayer/MatrixAbstractLayer.h"
	2. In CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot, access functions to gaze
	direction and origin take const vector3d& as argument instead of
	vector3d& in order to enforce the const propery of those access
	functions. 
	
	1. Removed template in classes declarations.
