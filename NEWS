New in 1.15.0, 2010-01-16:
* In CjrlDynamicRobot interface,
** methods relative to fixedJoint have been removed,
** method getSpecializedInverseKinematics and setActuatedJoints have been

* In CjrlHand interface
** handling of the wrist has been modified: some methods have been renamed:
*** vector3d & centerInWristFrame() -> getCenter(vector3d &outCenter),
*** vector3d &okayAxisInWristFrame() -> vector3d &okayAxisInWristFrame(),
*** vector3d &showingAxisInWristFrame() ->
     void getForeFingerAxis (vector3d &outForeFingerAxis),
*** vector3d &palmAxisInWristFrame() ->
     void getPalmNormal(vector3d &outPalmNormal),
    Old methods have been declared deprecated,
    setter have been added for each getter above.

* In CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot,
