\section intro Introduction

This package implements the abstract interface robotDynamics.
The algorithm considers a tree of bodies and compute forward dynamics
for a given configuration, and a given velocity.
The computation includes also linear and angular momentum, as well
as their derivatives, and finally the ZMP.
A specific object is the HumanoidDynamicMultiBody which specifies
a humanoid organization of the bodies: wait, arms, legs, head , etc...
All the algorithms are described in the book of Shuji Kajita "Humanoid Robot".
