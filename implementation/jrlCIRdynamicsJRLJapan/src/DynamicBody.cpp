/* Computation of the dynamical aspect for the body 
   of a model.
   OS: Almost all the modifications are related to the computation
   of the Resolved Momentum Control.

   OS: Updated the names of the contributors, the documentation
   and added a sample file for WalkPlugin
   OS (21/12/2006): removed any reference to non-homogeneous matrix
   library.
